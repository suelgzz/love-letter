1. **Download the Files**: Clone or download this repository.
2. **File Structure**:
   - `index.html`: The main HTML file.
   - `style.css`: Stylesheet for layout and animations.

   - Place your images (e.g., `photo.png`, `photo1.png`) and audio/video files in the same directory.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
2. Customize the content:
   - Replace placeholders like `[Your Name]`, `[Date]`, and `[Recipient's Name]` in the HTML.

   - Change the video iframe `src` to a YouTube embed URL or local video.
